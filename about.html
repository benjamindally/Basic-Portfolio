			<h2>About Me: How I Started</h2>
			<img id="selfie" alt="Picture of Benjamin Dally" title="Benjamin Dally: Web Developer" src="./assets/images/selfie.png"> 
			<p>My journey to the world of web design and developement is sereptitious as many often are. After completing an M.A. in Composition and Rhetoric in 2014, I was encouraged by a professor to send my thesis out to a peer reviewed online journal. Seeing no reason not to, I sent it to the journal Computers and Composition Online.</p> 
			<p>I had almost fogotten about the submission when I received an email saying they would accept it but only if I revised it and also designed it around a web site. The catch, just two months to complete it. But, this was an opportunity I couldn&apos;t pass up. Having absolutely no knowledge of web design, I accepted their proposal.</p>
		
			<p>And so began one of the most intense, challenging, and exhilerating few months of my life. I immersed myself in HTLM and CSS (and toyed with Javascript). Each day was filled with reading new journal articles, working full time in Europe, and writing web HTML/CSS. I cannot even beging to quanitfy how many YouTube videos I watched on coding and design. I went into the experience blindly, but I found that it was really opening my eyes.</p>
